## Hi there 👋
I'm Álvaro, an entrepreneur and human-centered tech enthusiast looking to channel technology towards our biggest problems. Lately I have been diving deep into on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, but lots of other fields excite me - I'm more driven by the potential change, rather than the underlying technology.

- 🔭 I’m currently looking for opportunities as an AI engineer or product engineer at early stage startups
- 🌱 I’m studying Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence @ TUM
- 👩‍💻 I'm proficient in Python, Java, C, Matlab and have used ML frameworks, like PyTorch and Tensorflow in the past
- 🚀 I've previously founded a sports development and automation startup, aiming to bring Pádel to the German speaking market. As the CTO, I lead a 4-person dev team, where we built our software platform with Python and React
- 💬 Ask me about ML, UX design, startups, how to cook a kick-ass Carbonara
- 📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alvaro-ritter) or via alvaro.ritter@cdtm.de
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm on a side quest to make the 2032 German Olympics team in Pádel
